# Schoolbox.Plugin

An unofficial plugin that enhances the SchoolBox experience for staff members by adding valuable student information and accessibility features.

This repository provides a distilled branch version of the bespoke framework implemented at Presbyterian Ladies College (PLC)‚ÄîMelbourne. It has been released with PLC's permission and is a rework of the bespoke source code, which excludes embedded business rules that may not be suitable for broader school communities. 

We aim to share our insights and work so that others can benefit from it and extend its features if necessary.

## Features

### üîä Student Name Pronunciation
On student profile page, display a speaker button next to student name to play pre-recorded pronunciations of students' names, allowing staff members to hear the correct pronunciation.

Available to Staff Role only.

### ‚úì Student Attendance Status
On student profile page, displays the current student attendance. This feature is only accessible to users with a "Staff Role" to allow them to quickly identify each student's attendance status, including reasons for absences.

Available to Staff Role only.

### üìÖ Student Timetable/Schedule
On student profile page, displays the student's schedule or timetable for today. This enables staff to quickly glance at the students' daily schedule and promptly identify their current class. It is a great way to aggregate schedules that come from multiple, unsynchronized sources outside of Schoolbox.

Available to Staff Role only.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Student Status Decoder
On student profile page, adds tooltip to student's status symbol assigned to position title. For staff, it decodes the `({{search}})` symbol with a helpful hint. Tooltips explain symbols and indicators assigned to students, improving understanding of student status markers and special notifications. This helps new staff members quickly learn the system.

Decodes for Staff Role only, otherwise it hides the symbol.

## Requirements
- Schoolbox version 22 or higher
- On-Prem Synergetic Database
